  - [ ] Verify device appears in Android Bluetooth "Paired devices" (not just "Available devices")
  - [ ] Confirm device name contains "Shimmer" or "RN42" (case-insensitive)
  - [ ] Re-pair device using PIN 1234 if necessary
  - [ ] Ensure device is properly bonded, not just connected

### Remaining Hardware Validation Tasks (After Proper Pairing)
- [ ] **Hardware Validation**: Test with properly paired Shimmer3 GSR+ devices
  - [ ] Verify ObjectCluster data extraction methods with real hardware
  - [ ] Validate multi-device concurrent streaming performance
  - [ ] Test Bluetooth reconnection scenarios and error recovery
- [ ] **API Refinement**: Confirm exact Shimmer SDK method names for advanced configuration
  - [ ] Verify sampling rate configuration methods
  - [ ] Confirm sensor range configuration API
  - [ ] Test advanced sensor calibration features
