## Usage Examples

### Basic Recording with Quality Management
```kotlin
// Initialize state persistence
recordingController.initializeStatePersistence(context)

// Set quality based on resources
val recommendedQuality = recordingController.getRecommendedQuality(context)
recordingController.setRecordingQuality(recommendedQuality)

// Start recording with validation
if (recordingController.validateRecordingPrerequisites(context)) {
    recordingController.startRecording(context, viewModel)
}
```

### Service Connection Monitoring
```kotlin
// Monitor service connection state
recordingController.serviceConnectionState.collect { state ->
    if (state.isConnected && state.isHealthy) {
        // Service is healthy and connected
    }
}

// Update service heartbeat
recordingController.updateServiceHeartbeat()
```
