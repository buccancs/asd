# Chapter 3: Problem Statement and Detailed Requirements

## 3.1 Comprehensive Problem Statement

### 3.1.1 Research Problem Context

The measurement of Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), also known as Electrodermal Activity (EDA), has been a cornerstone of physiological monitoring in psychological research, clinical assessment, and affective computing for over a century. Traditional GSR measurement requires direct skin contact through electrodes, typically placed on fingers or palms, creating several fundamental limitations that restrict its broader application and accessibility.

**Current Limitations of Contact-Based GSR Measurement:**

1. **Physical Constraints:** Contact electrodes restrict natural movement and behavior, potentially altering the very physiological responses being measured. This constraint is particularly problematic in studies requiring natural behavior or long-term monitoring.

2. **Hygiene and Safety Concerns:** Direct skin contact raises concerns about cross-contamination between subjects and the need for electrode cleaning and replacement, particularly relevant in clinical settings and during pandemic conditions.

3. **Comfort and Acceptance:** Many individuals find electrodes uncomfortable or anxiety-provoking, which can introduce artifacts into measurements or limit participation in studies, particularly among pediatric or elderly populations.

4. **Technical Maintenance:** Contact-based systems require electrode replacement, conductive gel application, and careful attention to contact quality, increasing operational complexity and potential points of failure.

5. **Limited Scalability:** Traditional systems typically monitor one or few individuals simultaneously, limiting applications in group studies, classroom environments, or large-scale population monitoring.

6. **Motion Artifacts:** Physical connections are susceptible to motion artifacts from electrode displacement or cable movement, requiring subjects to remain relatively stationary during measurements.

### 3.1.2 Research Gap Analysis

Through comprehensive literature review, several critical gaps in contactless physiological monitoring have been identified:

**Contactless GSR Detection Gap:**
Despite extensive research in contactless heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure monitoring, GSR detection remains largely unexplored. The limited existing research (Jo et al., 2021) provides preliminary evidence for feasibility but lacks the comprehensive system development and validation required for practical applications.

**Multi-Modal Integration Gap:**
Current contactless physiological monitoring approaches typically employ single sensing modalities. The potential for combining RGB and thermal imaging to enhance GSR detection has not been systematically explored, despite theoretical advantages for detecting sympathetic nervous system activation.

**Real-Time Processing Gap:**
Existing contactless physiological monitoring systems often process data offline or with significant delays. Real-time GSR prediction capabilities are essential for applications in biofeedback, adaptive systems, and immediate clinical assessment.

**Population Diversity Gap:**
Much of the existing research in contactless monitoring has been conducted on limited demographic groups, raising questions about generalizability across age, ethnicity, and health status. This limitation is particularly concerning for GSR, which exhibits significant individual differences.

**Ecological Validity Gap:**
Laboratory-based validation studies often use controlled conditions that may not reflect real-world usage scenarios. The performance of contactless GSR systems in naturalistic environments remains largely unknown.

### 3.1.3 Hypothesis and Research Questions

**Primary Research Hypothesis:**
Galvanic Skin Response can be predicted from contactless RGB-thermal video analysis of hand regions using machine learning techniques with sufficient accuracy for research and clinical applications.

**Secondary Hypotheses:**
1. Multi-modal RGB-thermal fusion provides superior GSR prediction accuracy compared to single-modality approaches
2. Multi-region-of-interest (Multi-ROI) analysis of hand landmarks improves prediction robustness compared to single-region approaches
3. The contralateral monitoring approach (predicting GSR from one hand using video of the opposite hand) demonstrates sufficient correlation for practical applications
4. Real-time implementation is feasible on consumer-grade hardware with acceptable latency and accuracy trade-offs

**Research Questions:**
1. Which hand regions provide the strongest correlation with GSR activity?
2. How do RGB and thermal modalities contribute to GSR prediction accuracy?
3. What machine learning architectures are most effective for video-based GSR prediction?
4. How do environmental factors (lighting, temperature, humidity) affect prediction accuracy?
5. What is the minimum dataset size required for robust cross-subject generalization?
6. How does prediction accuracy vary across demographic groups and individual differences?

### 3.1.4 Innovation and Contribution

## 3.2 Technical Problem Formulation

The contactless GSR prediction problem can be formally defined as a multi-modal, multi-temporal regression task:

**Input Space:**
- RGB Video Sequence: $V_{RGB} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times H \times W \times 3}$
- Thermal Video Sequence: $V_{thermal} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times H' \times W' \times 1}$
- Hand Landmark Coordinates: $L \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times 21 \times 2}$

Where:
- $T$ = temporal sequence length
- $H, W$ = RGB image dimensions
- $H', W'$ = thermal image dimensions
- 21 = number of MediaPipe hand landmarks

**Output Space:**
- GSR Signal: $G \in \mathbb{R}^{T}$
- Signal Quality Indicators: $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{T}$

**Objective Function:**
The system aims to learn a mapping function $f$ such that:
$$\hat{G} = f(V_{RGB}, V_{thermal}, L; \theta)$$

Where $\theta$ represents learnable parameters optimized to minimize:
$$\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \|G_t - \hat{G}_t\|_2^2 + \lambda \mathcal{R}(\theta)$$

With $\mathcal{R}(\theta)$ representing regularization terms to prevent overfitting.
