#### A.2 Installation and Configuration Procedures

**Python Application Setup:**

The installation process has been designed to minimize configuration complexity while ensuring proper integration with research computing environments typically found in academic institutions.

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/institution/multi-sensor-recording.git
cd multi-sensor-recording

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

#### A.3 Configuration Management

**System Configuration Structure:**

The configuration management system employs a hierarchical approach that separates system-level settings from experiment-specific parameters. This design choice facilitates rapid reconfiguration for different research protocols while maintaining system stability [CITE - Configuration management best practices].

```yaml
# config/system_config.yaml
system:
  network:
    port: 8765
    timeout: 30
    max_connections: 8
  
  devices:
    android:
      discovery_timeout: 10
      connection_retry: 3
    
    gsr_sensors:
      sampling_rate: 128
      connection_timeout: 15
  
  data_storage:
    base_path: "./data"
    compression: true
    backup_enabled: true

# config/experiment_config.yaml
experiment:
  session:
    duration: 300  # seconds
    warmup_time: 30
    cooldown_time: 15

    video_fps: 30
    thermal_fps: 25
    gsr_sampling: 128
```

#### A.4 Architecture Extension Guidelines

**Component Integration Framework:**

The system architecture has been designed with extensibility as a core principle, enabling integration of additional sensor modalities and processing algorithms without requiring fundamental architectural changes. Future developers should follow established patterns when adding new capabilities.

**Adding New Sensor Types:**

The sensor integration framework follows a plugin architecture that abstracts sensor-specific communication details while maintaining consistent data flow patterns throughout the system.

```python
# Example: Adding a new sensor type
class NewSensorDriver(BaseSensorDriver):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__(config)
        self.sensor_type = "new_sensor"
    
    async def connect(self):
        """Establish connection to sensor"""
        # Implementation specific to new sensor
        pass
    
    async def start_recording(self):
        """Begin data acquisition"""
        # Implementation with proper error handling
        pass
    
    def process_data(self, raw_data):
        """Convert raw data to standard format"""
        # Standardization for compatibility
        return standardized_data
```

**Network Protocol Extensions:**

The communication protocol has been designed with forward compatibility, allowing new message types and data formats to be added without disrupting existing functionality.

```python
# Protocol extension example
class ProtocolExtension:
    MESSAGE_TYPES = {
        'new_sensor_data': 'NEW_SENSOR_DATA',
        'new_command': 'NEW_COMMAND'
    }
    
    def handle_new_message(self, message):
        """Process new message types"""
        # Implementation following established patterns
        pass
```

#### A.5 Troubleshooting and Maintenance

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

Based on extensive testing and operational experience, several common issues have been identified along with their resolution procedures. The troubleshooting procedures follow systematic diagnostic approaches that isolate problems to specific system components.

**Network Connectivity Issues:**
```bash
# Diagnostic procedure
python -m tools.network_diagnostic
# Expected output: Connection status for all devices

# Common fixes
# 1. Reset network configuration
python -m tools.reset_network_config

# 2. Restart device discovery
python -m tools.restart_discovery
```

**Sensor Communication Problems:**
