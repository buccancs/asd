## Problem Statement

The fundamental research problem addressed by this thesis centers on the development of a comprehensive multi-sensor recording system specifically designed for contactless galvanic skin response (GSR) prediction research. This work emerges from significant limitations inherent in traditional physiological measurement methodologies that have constrained research applications for decades.

Traditional GSR measurement techniques rely on direct skin contact through metallic electrodes that measure electrodermal activity by applying a small electrical current across the skin surface. While this approach has been the gold standard in psychophysiological research since the early 20th century, it introduces several critical limitations that fundamentally affect both the quality of measurements and the range of possible research applications. The contact-based nature of traditional GSR sensors creates an inherent paradox: the very act of measurement can alter the physiological and psychological state being studied.

### Research Context and Current Limitations

The physiological measurement landscape faces several interconnected challenges that limit the effectiveness and applicability of current GSR research methodologies. Understanding these limitations is crucial for appreciating the significance of the contactless approach developed in this thesis.

**Intrusive Contact Requirements and Behavioral Alteration**: Traditional GSR sensors require the placement of electrodes on the participant's skin, typically on fingers or palm surfaces. This physical contact introduces a constant reminder of the measurement process, potentially altering natural behavior patterns and emotional responses. The psychological impact of being "wired up" can create anxiety or self-consciousness that directly affects the autonomic nervous system responses being measured. This challenge is particularly pronounced in studies of natural behavior, social interaction, or emotional response where the goal is to capture authentic physiological reactions.

**Movement Artifacts and Signal Degradation**: Physical electrode connections are highly susceptible to motion artifacts that can severely compromise data quality. During dynamic activities or natural movement, electrode displacement creates noise in the GSR signal that can mask the physiological responses of interest. This limitation effectively restricts traditional GSR measurement to stationary experimental setups, eliminating possibilities for studying physiological responses during natural movement, exercise, or real-world activities.

**Participant Discomfort and Measurement Bias**: The physical discomfort associated with electrode placement, particularly during extended recording sessions, can create measurement artifacts as participants adjust their posture or behavior to accommodate the sensors. The conductive gel required for electrode contact can cause skin irritation in sensitive individuals, while the restriction of natural hand movement affects the ecological validity of the measurements. These factors introduce systematic bias that compromises the generalizability of research findings.

**Scalability Limitations in Multi-Participant Studies**: Individual sensor attachment requirements create significant practical barriers for large-scale studies or multi-participant experimental designs. The time required for sensor setup and removal scales linearly with participant count, creating logistical challenges that limit experimental scope. Simultaneous measurement of multiple participants requires dedicated sensors for each individual, creating cost and complexity barriers that restrict research accessibility.

**Temporal and Logistical Constraints**: The setup and calibration time required for traditional GSR systems introduces temporal constraints that affect experimental design flexibility. Researchers must account for sensor attachment time in their protocols, while the need for specialized conductive gels and cleaning procedures between participants creates additional logistical overhead. These constraints particularly affect studies requiring rapid participant turnover or time-sensitive experimental protocols.

### Innovation Opportunity and Technical Approach

The Multi-Sensor Recording System developed in this thesis addresses these fundamental limitations through a revolutionary contactless approach that maintains research-grade measurement quality while eliminating the constraints of traditional contact-based methodologies. The system represents a paradigm shift from single-sensor, invasive measurement to multi-modal, non-contact physiological assessment.

The innovation lies in the integration of multiple complementary sensing modalities, each capturing different aspects of the physiological responses traditionally measured through direct GSR contact. This multi-modal approach provides redundancy and validation opportunities while enabling new forms of analysis not possible with traditional single-sensor approaches.

**RGB Camera Analysis for Visual Physiological Indicators**: High-resolution video capture enables the detection of subtle visual changes associated with autonomic nervous system activation. The system analyzes micro-expressions, color changes, and movement patterns that correlate with physiological arousal. Advanced computer vision algorithms extract features related to skin color variations, perspiration detection, and behavioral indicators that provide complementary information to traditional GSR measurements.

**Thermal Imaging for Vascular Response Detection**: Non-contact thermal measurement captures temperature variations associated with blood flow changes and autonomic nervous system activation. The thermal imaging component detects vasoconstriction and vasodilation patterns in extremities that strongly correlate with electrodermal activity. This modality provides physiologically relevant data while maintaining complete non-contact operation.

**Reference GSR Measurement for Ground Truth Validation**: Strategic integration of traditional contact-based GSR sensors provides ground truth data essential for machine learning model training and validation. This hybrid approach enables the development of accurate contactless prediction models while maintaining the gold standard measurement for comparison and calibration purposes.

**Synchronized Multi-Device Coordination for Temporal Precision**: The system achieves precise temporal alignment across all sensing modalities through advanced synchronization algorithms that compensate for network latency and device-specific timing variations. This coordination capability enables multi-participant studies with temporal precision comparable to traditional laboratory equipment while maintaining the flexibility of distributed measurement systems.
