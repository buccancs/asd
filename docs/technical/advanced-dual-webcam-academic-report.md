    return pulse
```

    hr_mask = (freqs >= 0.7) & (freqs <= 4.0)
    signal_power = np.sum(psd[hr_mask])
    
    # Noise power (outside HR band)
    noise_mask = ~hr_mask
    noise_power = np.sum(psd[noise_mask])
    
    return 10 * np.log10(signal_power / noise_power)
```

    spectral_concentration = hr_power / total_power
    
    # Peak prominence assessment
    hr_psd = psd[hr_mask]
    peak_prominence = np.max(hr_psd) / np.mean(hr_psd)
    
    # Combined SQI score
    sqi = 0.6 * spectral_concentration + 0.4 * normalized_prominence
