## 1. Introduction to Requirements Analysis

Requirements analysis represents the critical foundational process that forms the essential bridge between initial problem identification and comprehensive system design, systematically transforming high-level research objectives, user needs, and stakeholder expectations into specific, measurable, verifiable, and implementable system specifications that guide all subsequent development activities. For the sophisticated contactless GSR prediction system, this comprehensive analysis must address the extraordinarily complex interplay between demanding research requirements, stringent technical constraints, diverse user needs, evolving regulatory considerations, and the unique challenges posed by developing a research-grade physiological monitoring system that operates effectively across diverse environments while maintaining the precision and reliability standards required for scientific applications.

The requirements analysis process for this system employs rigorous systematic methodologies specifically adapted for complex research system development, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all system aspects while maintaining complete traceability from high-level research objectives through detailed implementation specifications. This analysis methodology recognizes that the system must serve multiple distinct stakeholder groups including research scientists, clinical investigators, technology developers, study participants, and regulatory oversight bodies, each with fundamentally different perspectives on system requirements, success criteria, and operational priorities.

The comprehensive scope of this requirements analysis encompasses not only the immediate functional requirements for contactless GSR prediction but also the broader ecosystem requirements for research data management, system integration, validation frameworks, regulatory compliance, and long-term maintainability that are essential for successful deployment and operation of research-grade physiological monitoring systems in diverse institutional and regulatory environments.

### 1.1 Requirements Engineering Methodology
