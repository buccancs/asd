# DeviceClient Protocol Documentation

## Overview

The DeviceClient module implements a socket-based communication protocol for connecting with Android devices running the Multi-Sensor Recording System application. This document describes the networking protocol, communication patterns, and implementation details.

## Protocol Architecture

### Connection Model
- **Server-Client Architecture**: DeviceClient acts as a server listening on a configurable port (default: 8080)
- **Multi-Device Support**: Supports multiple concurrent device connections
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: All device operations are protected by threading locks
- **PyQt Integration**: Uses PyQt signals for asynchronous GUI communication

### Network Configuration
```python
self.server_port = 8080              # Server listening port
self.buffer_size = 4096              # Socket buffer size
self.connection_timeout = 30         # Connection timeout (seconds)
self.heartbeat_interval = 5          # Heartbeat interval (seconds)
self.max_reconnect_attempts = 3      # Maximum reconnection attempts
```

### Enhanced Features (Version 2.0)
- **Reliable Message Delivery**: Application-level acknowledgments with retry logic
- **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Secure communication with configurable cipher suites
- **Rate Limiting**: DoS protection with sliding window algorithm
- **Capability Negotiation**: Dynamic feature discovery and configuration
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics collection and analysis

## Communication Protocol

### 1. Connection Establishment

#### Handshake Protocol
When a device connects, the following handshake occurs:

**Client → Server (Handshake Request)**
```json
{
    "type": "handshake",
    "client_type": "recording_controller",
    "protocol_version": "2.0",
    "timestamp": 1638360000.123,
    "device_info": {
        "model": "Samsung Galaxy S21",
        "os_version": "Android 12",
        "app_version": "1.2.3"
    },
    "capabilities": ["recording", "streaming", "thermal_imaging"]
}
```

**Server → Client (Handshake Response)**
```json
{
    "status": "accepted",
    "server_info": {"type": "recording_controller", "version": "2.0"},
    "timestamp": 1638360000.234,
    "negotiated_capabilities": ["recording", "streaming", "thermal_imaging"],
    "configuration": {
        "heartbeat_interval": 5,
        "acknowledgment_required": true,
        "compression": "gzip"
    }
}
```

#### Connection States
- `"connecting"`: Initial connection attempt
- `"connected"`: Successfully connected and authenticated
- `"disconnected"`: Connection closed
- `"error"`: Connection failed or encountered error

### 2. Command Protocol with Acknowledgments

Commands are sent as structured JSON messages with optional acknowledgment support:

**Command Message Format**
```json
{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "START",
    "parameters": {
        "mode": "recording",
        "duration": 300,
        "sensors": ["GSR", "thermal"]
    },
    "timestamp": 1638360000.123,
    "message_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "require_ack": true
}
```

**Acknowledgment Response**
```json
{
    "type": "acknowledgment",
    "ack_message_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "status": "success",
    "timestamp": 1638360000.234,
    "result": {
        "recording_started": true,
        "session_id": "rec_001"
    }
}
```

#### Supported Commands

| Command | Description | Parameters |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `START` | Start recording session | `mode`, `duration`, `sensors` |
| `STOP` | Stop current recording | None |
| `CALIBRATE` | Calibrate sensors | `sensor`, `type` |
| `STATUS` | Request device status | None |
| `PING` | Connection test | None |

### 3. Enhanced Security Features

#### SSL/TLS Configuration
```python
# Configure SSL/TLS encryption
client.configure_ssl(
    certfile="/path/to/server.crt",
    keyfile="/path/to/server.key",
    ca_certs="/path/to/ca_bundle.crt"  # Optional for client verification
)
```

**Security Properties:**
- **Minimum TLS Version**: 1.2
- **Recommended Cipher Suites**: ECDHE+AESGCM, ECDHE+CHACHA20
- **Certificate Validation**: X.509 with configurable CA verification

#### Rate Limiting
```python
# Rate limiting configuration
self._max_requests_per_minute = 60
self._rate_limiter: Dict[str, List[float]] = defaultdict(list)

def _check_rate_limit(self, device_ip: str) -> bool:
    # Sliding window rate limiter implementation
    current_time = time.time()
    requests = self._rate_limiter[device_ip]
    requests[:] = [t for t in requests if current_time - t < 60]
    
    if len(requests) >= self._max_requests_per_minute:
        return False
    
    requests.append(current_time)
    return True
```

### 4. Capability Negotiation

Dynamic feature discovery allows devices to negotiate supported capabilities:

```python
# Negotiate capabilities with device
capabilities = client.negotiate_capabilities(
    device_id=0,
    requested_capabilities=["recording", "streaming", "thermal_imaging", "gsr_monitoring"]
)

# Result: {"recording": True, "streaming": True, "thermal_imaging": True, "gsr_monitoring": False}
```

### 5. Performance Monitoring

Real-time performance metrics collection:

```python
metrics = client.get_performance_metrics()
print(f"Messages sent: {metrics['messages_sent']}")
print(f"Average latency: {metrics['average_latency_ms']}ms")
print(f"Connected devices: {metrics['connected_devices']}")
print(f"Pending acknowledgments: {metrics['pending_acknowledgments']}")
```

## Implementation Details

### DeviceClient Class Structure

```python
class DeviceClient(QThread):
    # Enhanced PyQt Signals
    device_connected = pyqtSignal(int, str)
    device_disconnected = pyqtSignal(int)
    frame_received = pyqtSignal(int, str, bytes)
    status_updated = pyqtSignal(int, dict)
    error_occurred = pyqtSignal(str)
```

### Key Methods

### Thread Safety

All device operations use threading locks:
```python
self._device_lock = threading.Lock()

with self._device_lock:
    # Thread-safe device operations
    device = self.devices[device_id]
```

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling with specific error types:
- Connection errors (timeout, refused, unreachable)
- Protocol errors (invalid JSON, missing fields)
- Network errors (socket failures, disconnections)
- Authentication errors (handshake failures, certificate validation)
- Rate limiting violations

## Performance Characteristics

## Usage Examples

### Basic Connection with Enhanced Features
```python
from PythonApp.src.network.device_client import DeviceClient

client = DeviceClient()

# Configure SSL for secure communication
client.configure_ssl("/path/to/cert.pem", "/path/to/key.pem")

# Connect signals
client.device_connected.connect(on_device_connected)
client.error_occurred.connect(on_error)

success = client.connect_to_device("192.168.1.100", 8080)
```

### Sending Commands with Acknowledgments
```python
# Start recording with acknowledgment required
success = client.send_command(0, "START", {
    "mode": "recording",
    "duration": 300,

# Send command without acknowledgment for non-critical operations
client.send_command(0, "PING", require_ack=False)
```

### Capability Negotiation
```python
# Negotiate capabilities with device
requested = ["recording", "streaming", "thermal_imaging", "gsr_monitoring"]
capabilities = client.negotiate_capabilities(0, requested)

if capabilities.get("thermal_imaging"):
    print("Thermal imaging supported")
    # Configure thermal imaging parameters
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
# Get real-time metrics
metrics = client.get_performance_metrics()
print(f"Connected devices: {metrics['connected_devices']}")
print(f"Average latency: {metrics['average_latency_ms']}ms")
print(f"Error rate: {metrics['error_count']/metrics['messages_sent']*100:.2f}%")
