# User Guide - Navigation Architecture and System Usage

This comprehensive guide provides detailed instructions for using the redesigned navigation architecture of the Multi-Sensor Recording System, including the simplified Android interface and modern Python desktop controller. The guide covers both basic usage patterns for new users and advanced workflows for experienced researchers.

## Navigation Architecture Overview

The Multi-Sensor Recording System features a completely redesigned navigation architecture that transforms complex, cluttered interfaces into clean, intuitive designs that prioritize user efficiency and system maintainability. This architectural transformation addresses the critical usability challenges of the original system while maintaining full access to advanced functionality through intelligent progressive disclosure.

### Design Principles and User Benefits

The navigation redesign follows established principles from modern human-computer interaction research, emphasizing clarity, consistency, and efficiency. The interface design reduces cognitive load by organizing functionality according to research workflow phases rather than technical system architecture, enabling users to focus on their experimental objectives while maintaining confident control over system operation.

**Workflow-Oriented Organization**: The interface organizes all functionality according to the natural progression of research activities, from initial device setup through data collection to analysis and export. This organization reduces the mental effort required to locate functions while providing logical transitions between different phases of research work.

        successful_images, 
        image_points, 
        (1920, 1080)  # Image size (width, height)
    )
    
    print(f"Calibration completed with RMS error: {result['rms_error']:.3f}")
    print(f"Quality recommendation: {result.get('quality_assessment', 'Unknown')}")
```
