# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the industry-standard CI/CD pipeline implemented for the Multi-Sensor Recording System. The pipeline includes automated testing, security scanning, performance monitoring, and quality assurance for both Android and Python components.

## Architecture

### Workflow Structure

The CI/CD pipeline consists of several interconnected workflows:

1. **Main CI/CD Pipeline** (`ci-cd.yml`) - Core build, test, and deployment
2. **Code Quality Analysis** (`qodana_code_quality.yml`) - Static analysis and quality metrics
3. **Security Scanning** (integrated in `ci-cd.yml`) - Vulnerability detection and security analysis
4. **Performance Monitoring** (`performance-monitoring.yml`) - Performance benchmarking and regression detection
5. **Dependency Management** (`dependency-management.yml`) - Automated dependency updates and security scanning
6. **Integration Testing** (`integration-testing.yml`) - Comprehensive integration and cross-platform testing

conda activate thermal-env

# Install enhanced test dependencies
pip install -r test-requirements.txt
```

./gradlew AndroidApp:connectedDebugAndroidTest

# Python tests
cd PythonApp
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Code quality checks

- Dependency update tracking issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
1. **Gradle Build Issues**: Check Java version compatibility and dependency conflicts
2. **Python Environment Issues**: Verify conda environment and dependency versions
3. **Test Failures**: Review test logs and consider environment-specific issues

#### Performance Issues
1. **Slow Builds**: Review caching configuration and dependency resolution
2. **Test Timeouts**: Adjust timeout settings and optimize test execution
3. **Resource Constraints**: Monitor runner resource usage and adjust matrix size

#### Security Scan Issues
1. **False Positives**: Update security tool configurations and baseline files
2. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Review and update dependencies or add exceptions
3. **Secret Detection**: Review and remediate any exposed secrets

### Best Practices

#### Code Quality
