## 1. Introduction

The Multi-Sensor Synchronized Recording System represents a sophisticated distributed computing solution specifically designed for contactless galvanic skin response (GSR) prediction through advanced RGB-thermal video analysis. This comprehensive system leverages the complementary strengths of mobile and desktop computing platforms to create a robust, research-grade physiological monitoring environment that meets the stringent requirements of scientific data collection while maintaining practical usability for research applications.

The system architecture embodies a carefully designed separation of concerns that optimizes each platform for its unique capabilities. The Android application serves as the primary data acquisition engine, leveraging the mobility, integrated sensors, and real-time processing capabilities of modern smartphones. The Python desktop application functions as the central command and control system, providing sophisticated data analysis capabilities, comprehensive visualization tools, and coordinated multi-device management functionality.

This distributed approach enables the system to achieve performance characteristics that would be difficult or impossible to accomplish with a single-platform solution. The mobile component provides intimate access to hardware sensors, camera systems, and real-time processing capabilities, while the desktop component offers unlimited processing power, extensive storage capacity, and sophisticated analysis algorithms that require computational resources beyond those available on mobile devices.

## 2. System Architecture

Each component is optimized for specific aspects of the data collection and analysis workflow, creating a synergistic relationship that enhances the overall system performance.

### 2.1 Android Application Component

The Android application serves as the mobile data collection platform, responsible for orchestrating complex multi-sensor data acquisition, real-time video processing, and maintaining reliable communication with the central control system. This component is implemented in **Kotlin** and leverages several advanced Android APIs to achieve research-grade data collection capabilities.

**Key APIs and Technologies:**
- **Camera2 API**: Provides low-level access to camera hardware, enabling precise control over exposure, focus, and timing parameters essential for consistent video data collection

- **USB Thermal Camera SDK**: Enables integration with external thermal imaging devices for contactless temperature monitoring
- **Android NDK**: Provides native code execution for computationally intensive real-time processing tasks

The Android application is specifically designed to function as a distributed data collection node capable of autonomous operation while maintaining coordination with the central system. This design enables robust data collection even in environments with intermittent network connectivity, ensuring that valuable research data is never lost due to temporary communication failures.

### 2.2 Python Desktop Application Component

The Python desktop application functions as the central command and control system, providing comprehensive data analysis capabilities, sophisticated visualization tools, and coordinated management of multiple data collection devices. This component is built using **PyQt5** for the user interface framework and integrates numerous specialized libraries for data processing and analysis.

**Core Framework and Libraries:**
- **PyQt5**: Provides advanced GUI capabilities with professional-quality interface elements optimized for research applications
- **OpenCV**: Enables sophisticated computer vision processing, including calibration, feature extraction, and real-time video analysis
- **NumPy/SciPy**: Provides high-performance numerical computing capabilities for signal processing and statistical analysis
- **Socket Programming**: Implements custom networking protocols for real-time communication with mobile devices

The desktop application serves as the central nervous system of the entire data collection infrastructure, coordinating multiple devices, managing data storage, and providing real-time monitoring capabilities that enable researchers to ensure data quality throughout the collection process.

## 4. Component Interaction Flow

The system implements a sophisticated interaction pattern that ensures reliable data collection while maintaining flexibility for various research scenarios. The interaction flow encompasses several distinct phases that work together to provide comprehensive physiological monitoring capabilities.

### Data Collection Phase
The Android application initiates multi-sensor data capture, coordinating camera systems, physiological sensors, and thermal imaging devices to collect synchronized multi-modal data streams. This coordination requires precise timing control to ensure that data from different sources can be properly aligned during analysis.

### Network Synchronization Phase
Real-time communication protocols enable bidirectional data flow between mobile and desktop components. The desktop system provides configuration commands and timing signals, while the mobile system streams collected data and status information. This communication layer implements robust error detection and recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity.

### Analysis and Processing Phase
The Python application receives data streams and performs real-time quality assessment, feature extraction, and preliminary analysis. This processing provides immediate feedback about data quality and enables researchers to make informed decisions about data collection parameters during active recording sessions.

### Calibration Coordination Phase
Cross-platform calibration procedures ensure that data collected from multiple devices can be properly integrated and analyzed. The calibration process involves geometric alignment of camera systems, temporal synchronization of data streams, and validation of sensor accuracy across the entire system.
