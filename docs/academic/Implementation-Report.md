└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 3.1.1 Component Validation Engine

The validation engine implements a formal verification approach:

```kotlin
/**
 * Formal validation engine implementing systematic UI component verification
 * based on predicate logic and invariant preservation.
 */
class ValidationEngine {
    /**
     * Primary validation function implementing comprehensive component analysis
     * 
     * @param components Set of UI components requiring validation
     * @return Formal validation result with error classification
     */
    fun validateComponents(components: Set<UIComponent>): ValidationResult {
        return components.map { component ->
            validateIndividualComponent(component)
        }.aggregateResults()
    }
    
    /**
     * Individual component validation using predicate-based approach
     */
    private fun validateIndividualComponent(component: UIComponent): ComponentValidation {
        val predicates = listOf(
            ExistencePredicate(),
            FunctionalityPredicate(),
            AccessibilityPredicate(),
            PerformancePredicate()
        )
        
        return predicates.map { predicate ->
            predicate.evaluate(component)
        }.combineResults()
    }
}
```

#### 3.1.2 Error Recovery Engine

The recovery engine implements intelligent error handling with mathematical convergence guarantees:

```kotlin
/**
 * Intelligent error recovery system with provable convergence properties
 * based on contractive mapping theory.
 */
class RecoveryEngine {
    /**
     * Primary recovery function implementing systematic error resolution
     * 
     * @param errorContext Current system error state
     * @return Recovery result with action trace
     */
    fun recoverFromErrors(errorContext: ErrorContext): RecoveryResult {
        val recoveryStrategy = selectOptimalStrategy(errorContext)
        return executeRecoveryStrategy(recoveryStrategy, errorContext)
    }
    
    /**
     * Strategy selection using formal decision theory
     */
    private fun selectOptimalStrategy(context: ErrorContext): RecoveryStrategy {
        return when (context.severity) {
            ErrorSeverity.CRITICAL -> CriticalRecoveryStrategy()
            ErrorSeverity.MAJOR -> MajorRecoveryStrategy()
            ErrorSeverity.MINOR -> MinorRecoveryStrategy()
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3.1.3 Accessibility Engine

The accessibility engine implements universal design principles with formal compliance verification:

```kotlin
/**
 * Universal accessibility engine implementing WCAG 2.1 compliance
 * through systematic design principle application.
 */
class AccessibilityEngine {
    /**
     * Comprehensive accessibility feature enablement
     * 
     * @param context Application context for feature initialization
     * @return Accessibility compliance result
     */
    fun enableAccessibilityFeatures(context: Context): AccessibilityResult {
        val features = listOf(
            ScreenReaderSupport(),
            HighContrastMode(),
            TouchTargetOptimization(),
            ContentDescriptionManager(),
            FocusManagement()
        )
        
        return features.map { feature ->
            feature.enable(context)
        }.aggregateAccessibilityResults()
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Integration Architecture

#### 3.2.1 Dependency Injection Implementation

The system employs Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection, ensuring testability and modularity:

```kotlin
@Module
@InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)
object UIControllerModule {
    
    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideUIController(): UIController = UIController()
    
    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideMainActivityCoordinator(
        uiController: UIController
    ): MainActivityCoordinator = MainActivityCoordinator(uiController)
}
```

#### 3.2.2 Coordinator Pattern Implementation

The coordinator pattern ensures clean separation between UI logic and business logic:

```kotlin
/**
 * MainActivity coordinator implementing the coordinator pattern
 * for clean architecture separation.
 */
@Singleton
class MainActivityCoordinator @Inject constructor(
    private val uiController: UIController
) : UIController.UICallback {
    
    /**
     * Coordinate UI initialization with validation
     */
    fun initializeUI(activity: MainActivity) {
        uiController.setCallback(this)
        
        val validationResult = uiController.validateUIComponents()
        if (!validationResult.isValid) {
            val recoveryResult = uiController.recoverFromUIErrors()
            handleRecoveryResult(recoveryResult)
        }
        
        uiController.enableAccessibilityFeatures()
